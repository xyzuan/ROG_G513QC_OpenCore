## Description

- Available version of this repository: Sonoma
- The model information has been removed, please generate and replace it yourself
- OpenCore version: 0.9.5
- BIOS settings:
  - Suggest using [UMAF](https://github.com/DavidS95/Smokeless_UMAF/) tool to increase VRAM, at least 1G and recommend 2G
  - Use [UMAF](https://github.com/DavidS95/Smokeless_UMAF/) tool to enable `Above 4G decoding`
  - Turn off `Secure Boot` and `Fast Boot`
- This repository does not include NootedRed drivers, please go to [NootedRed](https://github.com/ChefKissInc/NootedRed) to download and add them yourself.
- Updating EFI may require clearing NVRAM to take full effect.

> [!Warning]
> When installing or updating the system, be sure to disable the `NootedRed` driver in `config.plist`, otherwise the installation process will get stuck at the progress bar and cannot be installed normally.

## Configuration

| Component            | Model (2020/2021)         |
| :------------------- | :------------------------ |
| CPU                  | AMD Ryzen 5 5600H         |
| Integrated GPU       | AMD Radeon Vega 8         |
| Dedicated GPU        | NVIDIA RTX 3050           |
| Network/Bluetooth    | Intel AX210               |
| SSD                  | SAMSUNG M.2 MZVQL5        |
| Keyboard/Trackpad    | IC2 HID                   |
| Audio/Headphone jack | ALC294                    |

## Overview

### Working

- CPU / IGPU
  - Use [AMDPowerGadget](https://github.com/trulyspinach/SMCAMDProcessor) for CPU power management and temperature monitoring.
  - Use [RadeonSensor](https://github.com/NootInc/RadeonSensor) to monitor GPU temperature.
- WIFI/Bluetooth
- Apple ID & iMessages & iCloud
- Interrupt mode touchpad and keyboard input
- 1080p 120hz HiDPI display
- Built-in speakers and 3.5mm headphone audio output / Built-in microphone
- All USB ports / NVME SSD
- S3 Sleep
  - Use [UMAF](https://github.com/DavidS95/Smokeless_UMAF/) tool to enable `S3 Sleep`
  - Might need to enter the following commands in the terminal:
    ```
    sudo pmset autopoweroff 0
    sudo pmset powernap 0
    sudo pmset standby 0
    sudo pmset proximitywake 0
    sudo pmset tcpkeepalive 0
    ```

### Not working and current issues
- NVIDIA graphics card
- Chrome and Chromium browsers cannot use hardware acceleration normally, waiting for [NootedRed](https://github.com/ChefKissInc/NootedRed) driver update to resolve
- Some Fn shortcut keys
- After using Windows and restarting to macOS, there is no sound from the headphones. A forced shutdown and reboot will make it work normally again.
- VCN (video/image hardware encoding/decoding) still has some problems, can be used but not guaranteed, turned off by default, to turn on, please add `-nredvcn` to `boot-args`. For details, please go to the NootedRed page to see the latest progress.

### Temperature

You can control the temperature within a suitable range by turning off `CPS (core performance boost)`, but this will lose some performance. You can use the UMAF tool to turn off `CPS` in the BIOS, but it will affect the performance of other systems such as Windows, so it is recommended to use AMD Power Gadget to turn it off after each boot into the system, at least for now.
